## About
HugAPet is designed to streamline the process of connecting pet shelters with potential adopters and concerned citizens who encounter lost animals. By centralizing information about found animals, available adoptions, and donation needs, we aim to facilitate faster and more efficient pet rescue and adoption processes.

- **Animal Listings:** Shelters can list information about found animals and animals available for adoption.
- **Donation Requests:** Shelters can specify their requirements for donations such as food, blankets, or medical supplies.
- **User Reporting:** Users can report found animals or animals wandering in specific areas.
- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for animals based on various criteria such as species, breed, location, etc.
- **User Profiles:** Users can create profiles to save favorite animals, track adoption requests, and manage donations.
- **Notifications:** Users receive notifications about animals matching their preferences or updates from shelters they follow.
